# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the models/subfolder
# based on the `+materialized` config. Also defines the schema for each folder.
# Additional macro has been defined to set the schema for each folder based on the target (default is dev).
# environment (macros/generate_schema.sql). This is useful for separating development, staging, and production environments.
# In the current setup dev/staging/production are separated by schemas. Ideally, you would
# want to have a separate database for each environment
